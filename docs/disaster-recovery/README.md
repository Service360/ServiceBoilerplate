# Disaster recovery runbooks

This folder should contain documentation on how to recover service in
cases of disaster: database failure, network outage, etc.

## Risk alert

If this folder is missing (or contains only boilerplate code, 
see DELETEME.md) Service360 will raise a LOW level alert.

Service360 does not analyze the content of the directory.
