# Release runbooks

This folder should contain documentation on how to release/rollback (!) 
service to production/staging/whatever else environment.

## Risk alert

If this folder is missing (or contains only boilerplate code, 
see DELETEME.md) Service360 will raise a LOW level alert.

Service360 does not analyze the content of the directory.
