# Architectural decision records

ADRs (Architectural decision records) are a great and easy to implement
idea which eases on-boarding of new team members a lot.

You can read more on ADR on [ThinkRelevance.com](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
or in [ThoughtWorks TechRadar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records)

Service360 does not require this directory to exist and will 
raise no risk flags in case this directory is missing. 
But we highly recommend you to adopt this technique. 
At least for the core projects time spent on the ADR writing is 
time well-spent and it will pay off greatly.
