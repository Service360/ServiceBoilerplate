# Common operations runbooks

This folder should contain documentation on the most common manual
operations done for the service maintenance.

We would recommend to put every runbook in a separate file 
with self-describing name. Consider to start each runbook name with
"how-to-..." prefix.

## Examples of runbooks names

- how-to-generate-payment-report.md
- how-to-check-amount-of-non-processed-orders.md
- how-to-change-queue-processing-speed.md
- how-to-cleanup-dlq.md

## Risk alert

If this folder is missing (or contains only boilerplate code, 
see DELETEME.md) Service360 will raise a LOW level alert.

Service360 does not analyze or make any assumptions on the contents 
of this directory.
