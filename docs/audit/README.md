# Service Audit

This folder should contain results of the service audits.

Documentation usually tends to get out of date over time. One way to
make sure it is still up-to-date and useful is to periodically review 
it. Service Audit is the process designed to help maintain service
documentation in the most up-to-date and useful way. 

Audit file should be named YYYY-MM-DD.md.

[Service Audit template](TEMPLATE.md) can be found in this folder.

## Risk alert

Alert level depends on the date of the last audit. If there is no 
audit documentation found, then Service360 assumes that date of last 
audit is the date of the first contribution (service creation date). 

- No alert: Less than 180 days since last audit
- Low level alert: More than 180 but less than 360 days since last audit
- Medium level alert: Over 360 days since last audit
