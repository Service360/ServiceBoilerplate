# Development runbooks

This folder should contain documentation on how to develop the service:
how to prepare local environment, what kind of agreements do exist, 
how to run tests, etc.

## Risk alert

If this folder is missing (or contains only boilerplate code, 
see DELETEME.md) Service360 will raise a LOW level alert.

Service360 does not analyze the content of the directory.
